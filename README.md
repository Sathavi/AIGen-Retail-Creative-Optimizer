# AIGen Retail Creative Optimizer

## Overview
AIGen Retail Creative Optimizer is a Generative AI–based hackathon prototype that automatically generates platform-optimized retail ad creatives.  
It reduces manual design effort by producing multiple static ad variations tailored for different retail media platforms.

This project was developed as part of the **Tesco Retail Media InnovAItion Jam** to demonstrate feasibility, not as a production-ready system.

## Problem Statement
Retail and e-commerce teams spend significant time manually creating ad creatives for multiple platforms such as Instagram, Amazon Ads, and Google Ads.  
Each platform requires different image sizes, layouts, copy styles, and CTAs, making the process repetitive, slow, and difficult to scale—especially for small and mid-size brands.
